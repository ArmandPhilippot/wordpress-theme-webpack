![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/boilerplates-collection/wordpress-theme-webpack?color=blue&colorA=4c4f56&label=License&style=flat-square) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/boilerplates-collection/wordpress-theme-webpack?color=blue&colorA=4c4f56&label=Version&style=flat-square)

A WordPress boilerplate to develop themes with webpack.

## Requirements

* You need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) in order to install dependencies.

* This boilerplate uses Standard version to generate a changelog and Husky to validate commits, so you need to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

* In order to avoid the warnings related to the local use of `https`, you will need a valid certificate. You can achieve this with [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).
